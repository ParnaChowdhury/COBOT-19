## **COBOT-19**
A covid-19 chatbot.

A Chatbot which answers queries related to Covid-19. We wanted to learn about Dialogflow and this bot is built using the same. We wish to improve the not further by adding more information, making it more personable and integrating pie-charts, bar-graphs etc for visual representation of information.

It was my first attempt on creating a project with Dialogflow. It's the winner of Best Use of Google Cloud in Hackcade, a hackathon organised with MLH. It has also been submitted to HackOn 2.0, another hackathon. The submission for both these hackathons were made on May 30, 2021.
